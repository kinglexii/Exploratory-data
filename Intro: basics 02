#another function to create vectors is 'seq', example
#this will print out 1  10
seq(1,10)
#this will print out only the odd numbers because we specified that the sequence should start from 1 and end at 10 in increments of 2
seq(1,10,2)
#this prodeces integers

#subsetting a vector to access a specific part of it, use square brackets
#can acess one element of the vector
codes[2]
#can access several elements of the vector
codes[c(1,3)]
codes[1:2]
codes[1:3]
#access a specific name in the vector, use quotes
